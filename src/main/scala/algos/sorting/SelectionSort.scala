/**
  * Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm
  * in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end.
  * Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
  *
  * The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element
  * becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.
  *
  * This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities are of ÎŸ(n2),
  * where n is the number of items.
  *
  * Time = O(n2)
  * Space = O(1) Inplace sorting
