  *
  * Given a Binary Tree, print all nodes that donâ€™t have a sibling (a sibling is a node that has same parent.
  * In a Binary Tree, there can be at most one sibling). Root should not be printed as root cannot have a sibling.
  *
  * This is a typical tree traversal question. We start from root and check if the node has one child, if yes then print
  * the only child of that node. If node has both children, then recur for both the children.
