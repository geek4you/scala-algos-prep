/**
  * Symmetric Tree (Mirror Image of itself)
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself.

For example, this binary tree is symmetric:

     1
   /   \
  2     2
 / \   / \
3   4 4   3
But the following is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3

 The idea is to write a recursive function isMirror() that takes two trees as argument and returns true if trees are mirror and false if trees are not mirror. The isMirror() function recursively checks two roots and subtrees under the root.
