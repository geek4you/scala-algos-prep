 * Distance between 2 nodes in BST

 * hint: can use LCA for this.
 * <p>
 * Computation of lowest common ancestors may be useful, for instance, as part of a procedure for determining the
 * distance between pairs of nodes in a tree: the distance from n1 to n2 can be computed as the distance from the root
 * to n1, plus the distance from the root to n2, minus twice the distance from the root to their lowest common ancestor.
 * <p>
 * distance = (dist from root to node1) + (dist from root to node 2) - 2 * (distance of root from LCA)
